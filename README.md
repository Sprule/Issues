# Issues
Report issues with forums.gg here!

### Do:

* Search the issue tracker to ensure that your issue is not a duplicate
* Verify the validity and/or plausibility of your issue
* Be clear and concise in your description
* Take advantage of [GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/)--it's awesome, and it makes your submission that much better! :smile:
* Create a unique issue for each feature/bug-report

### Do not:

* Bump issues to receive a response (all issues are acknowledged)
* Argue unproductively in an issue's comments
* Re-create an issue you feel unjustly closed
* Add comments such as :+1:, +1 or "I like this idea"
* Submit issues that are general suggestions, as opposed to *specific, technical* bugs or *confirmed* features
* Create disrespectful or inflammatory comments
